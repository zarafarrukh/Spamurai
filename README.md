## Project Information
In today's digital age, the inundation of spam emails pose a significant challenge for individuals and organizations alike. To tackle this persistent challenge, we present SPAMURAI  - a program designed to sift through and eliminate spam emails. Our spam detector, <b><i>SPAMURAI</i></b>, employs a unigram approach, meticulously analyzing each word within an email to ascertain its spam status. SPAMURAI exhibits a remarkable ability to differentiate between spam & legitimate emails by calculating probabilities based on word frequency, ensuring high accuracy in its assessments. The system has been trained using a diverse dataset encompassing both spam and non-spam emails, and the SpamDetector class has been crafted to facilitate model reading, testing, and training. With a robust set of samples at its disposal, the program excels at sieving out unwanted messages. The algorithm boasts a 76.6% accuracy rate and an 80.7% precision rate, providing assurance of SPAMURAI's reliability.

## Improvements
We optimized the SpamDetector class by using HashMaps and ArrayLists to efficiently store and retrieve data values, reducing the search complexity to O(n). We simplified the code by eliminating a redundant testing function, integrating test results directly into the trainAndTest method, and reducing code duplication by generating a duplicate method. We simplified variable control by using getters and setters for accuracy and precision, as well as used an isWord function to simplify the handling of unique words and symbols. These optimizations all together enhanced the algorithm's performance, readability, and maintainability. Notably, SPAMURAI boosts an impressive 76.6 % accuracy rate and an 80.7 % precision rate, which underscores its reliability and effectiveness in combating spam.

The **HTML** and **CSS** composition defines a webpage featuring distinct sections such as a header, home, and about, complemented by a responsive data table. The CSS styling enhances the visual appeal with bespoke design elements, utilizing the 'Poppins' font and maintaining a cohesive color scheme through predefined variables. The integration of JavaScript introduces interactive elements, including a sticky navbar and engaging animations on both the dashboard and about pages. Moreover, the **JavaScript** code leverages the fetch API to dynamically retrieve accuracy and precision data from a server, seamlessly presenting it on the webpage. The structured and modular codebase ensures ease of customization and lays a solid foundation for future enhancements, contributing to a streamlined development process.

Moving forward we would focus on enhancing our algorithm by implementing Laplace Smoothing, a technique renowned for handling unseen words, thereby enhancing the model's predictive accuracy and precision. We would also enhance our algorithm to handle a diverse range of special characters and symbols to ensure optimal performance across varied input scenarios
